# Crawling-with-Apache-Nutch
Our mini-project idea revolves around building a small scale crawler using
Apache Nutch 2.3 and hbase 0.94 which can if needed, with enough parallel
computing be expanded into a large scale web crawler.
We use Apache Nutch 2 because unlike Apache Nutch 1, it can resume we
crawling should it be terminated for some reason like power failure.
